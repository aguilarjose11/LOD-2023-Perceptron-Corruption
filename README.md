McNair Scholars Research: Data Corruption and PAC Learning.
===========================================================

Welcome!

This repository contains the code used for the upcoming presentation at the National Undergraduate Research Conference (NCUR). This research has been sponsored by the Ronald E. McNair Post-Baccalaureate Achievement Program at The University of Oklahoma (OU) and supervised by [Dr. Dimitrios I. Diochnos](http://diochnos.com/) from the University of Oklahoma, Gallogly College of Engineering, School of Computer Science.

Description
-----------

The objective of this research effort is to uncover potential "removal-resistant" data poisoning in datasets. By performing random data corruption in datasets, we simulate the poisoning insertion and subsequent removal from a dataset. The PAC learning bounds of a PAC-learnable algorithm are then analysed to observe the behaviour of the true score against the non-noisy data.
